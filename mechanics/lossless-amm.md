# Lossless AMM

The biggest fear of all makers when providing liquidity to earn passive income is impermanent loss. PerpDEX offers a solution to such problems with the introduction of Lossless AMM. Instead of bearing loss on the maker side, Lossless AMM calculates the virtual impermanent loss prior to conducting the actual transaction and distributes that difference to each transaction during the swap process and that becomes part of the transaction fee. The maker never suffers an impermanent loss while the overall portfolio is kept maintained.
